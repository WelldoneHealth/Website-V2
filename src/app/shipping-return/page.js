                Sellers incur relatively high shipping costs on low-priced
                items. In such cases, charging a nominal delivery charge helps
                them cover the logistics costs. Please check your order
                summary to understand delivery charges for individual
                products.

                For products listed as Welldone, the order value is Rs. If
                less than 500 a delivery charge of Rs 40 per item may be
                applied. So Rs. Orders of 500 or more are delivered free of
                charge.

              It is possible that the seller or our courier partners will have
              a holiday between the day you place your order and the delivery
              date, based on the timeline shown on the product page. In this
              case, we add one day to the estimated date. Some courier
              partners and vendors do not work on Sundays and this depends on
              delivery dates.
